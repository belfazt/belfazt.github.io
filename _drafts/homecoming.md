I've been in Mexico since May, I decided that I had to return around mid March as I was going through depression,
which I believe was caused by several factors. Loneliness being one of those and probably the main one.

The thing that allowed me to keep extending the time that I was spending in Austria was the ability to travel easily within Europe
