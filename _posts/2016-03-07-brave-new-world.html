<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">So, it's been a while again since my last post, I didn't have much willing on writing another entry.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">It's been an awesome ride so far:</span><br /><ul><li><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">School is coming to an end soon, I'll be able to officially call myself an engineer because a paper says that I'm one and that is a bit funny.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">[Awesome] I'm really happy that <a href="https://twitter.com/jimadrigals" target="_blank">the girl that I love</a> has been supporting me since I changed my major. I got to know her a bit before of taking that decission.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I think that I'm doing well at my job (or that's what the upper management makes me believe heh)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I've been reading (Thanks Google Play Books)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I've been sleeping a lot less (Thanks Counter-Strike and Dota2) </span></li></ul><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">PS. I'm really tired of school.</span>
