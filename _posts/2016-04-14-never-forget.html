<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I will never forget this day, things go south faster than you realize.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Feels so bad, you are just answering a question, being yourself, you don't know how to express your thoughts... and suddenly you feel like crap, you don't know what's going on, your brain is traveling, you're running, you don't feel like yourself. Suddenly everything slows down and you're still lost... and writing a crappy blog post that is poorly redacted.</span>
