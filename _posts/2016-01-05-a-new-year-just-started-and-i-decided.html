<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A new year just started and I decided that I wanted to have a fresh new blog. So Hello World!!!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Last year was a good one, it had a lot of good things and a lot of bad things as well, I changed a lot during the year and had a lot weird days. I know that this year is going to be a lot different. I started reading last year and the idea right now is to read at least one book per month, I also want to be able to run 10k in six months or so.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Happy New Year to anyone that reads this!</span>
