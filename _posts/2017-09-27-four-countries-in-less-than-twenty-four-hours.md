Three days have passed since I arrived, more or less, it was a wild ride and probably something that I'd do again.

## Getting home

My [girlfriend](https://twitter.com/jimadrigals) isn't living in Guadalajara anymore which is where we both lived before, she moved to Monterrey by the beginning of August, I was there for a week before leaving for my [adventure]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-23-im-going-on-an-adventure %}) we decided that it would be cool to say *see you soon* at Guadalajara's Airport so we flew together from Monterrey to Guadalajara.


## Arriving at the airport

My girlfriend's family was kind enough to drive me to the airport at 4:30 am (They are awesome people).

  - Checked my baggage
  - Chatted for a while
  - Had breakfast(Krispy Kreme)
  - Went through security

Getting on the plane was one of the hardest emotional challenges that I've had, logically it was a no brainer decision, emotional was an interesting debate that I won't get into

## GDL - MCO (Plane)

I didn't sleep the night before because we were packaging everything and fighting with the bags so that they would weight a certain amount, sadly you cannot take as much luggage as you want in a plane, as weird as it sounds

In this plane I felt sad for a bit, thought a bit about life but was tired so I felt asleep in no time, woke up from time to time to take pictures but that was it.

## MCO - DUS (Plane)

After going through migration I went directly to check my baggage with AirBerlin and I thought that there would be issues because I was carrying my Violin, a backpack plus my carry-on, the lady said that there wasn't an issue, that I could just board with all of that for which I'm really grateful (Wouldn't have made a lot of sense being so close to Vienna and not having my Violin with me).

There was a lot going through my mind at the time and couldn't sleep much but wasn't really that tired somehow, however I got to snag some nice pictures :smile:

The first cultural shock that I had was the breakfast on the plane, don't get me wrong, it was really good but expected something else, however it really got me in a different mood to be ready for everything

## DUS - VIE (Plane)

I was reliefed that we arrived safely, migration here is a lot easier than in the US, so everything was *cool*

Slept from the moment I got on through the moment the plane touched land.

## VIE - LZS (Train)

Took some time at the Vienna airport to have some food, check some stuff out and relax for a bit.

Was hard to get on the train with all the luggage that I had on myself.

## Linz

After getting to Linz I went to get some food at the hauptbahnhof and proceeded to go to the place where I'm staying. Afterwards I was in shock of everything that happened in the last twenty four hours and felt a bit sad and weird, I decided to hit up my friend Alex the Rumanian and he was kind enough to cheer me up a bit.

He and his girlfriend took me for dinner to Český_Krumlov which is a town in the border of the Czech Republic and Austria, I'm super grateful for this.

Here's a picture of the castle that is inside of the town.
